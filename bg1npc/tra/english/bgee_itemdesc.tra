@9   = ~A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield.  Its weight prevents the character from using his shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield.  Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from 3'-4' in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a spread dragon's wings.  A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward.

This particular shield bears the coat of arms of the noble Ilvastarr family of Waterdeep: a metallic green dragon with orange eyes on a golden field.

@76   = ~One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  Having reached this end, weaponers began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.

@79   = ~The body shield, also known as the kite or tower shield, is a massive metal or wooden shield reaching nearly from the chin to the toe of the user. It must be firmly fastened to the forearm, and the shield hand must firmly grip it at all times. Naturally, this precludes use of the shield hand for anything but holding the body shield in place.

@80   = ~The large shield is carved from a rare white oak, which has all the strength but not the weight of the regular oak. The noble stamina of the wood seems to reflect on the shield bearer. It was created by the druids, and the bindings that secure this body shield on the hero's forearm will become magically undone, if it is used by the hand that does not strive to maintain the Balance.

@174  = ~This bardic chainmail has an illustrious past, being the armor of the noted half-elven bard Myr'Cutio. He wandered the Realms seeking adventure, and so restless was his nature that on his death his spirit, and those of his companions, continued to roam...

This armor was further improved by Halbazzer Drin of the Sorcerous Sundries store in Baldur's Gate. Combination with a pair of golden pantaloons has afforded an increased measure of protection, while keeping the suit as fashionable as ever.

@224  = ~This is a rather tacky looking necklace decorated with a few large gemstones. A small inscription in elvish on the lock of the necklace says that the item was created by Nadyala the Green as her thesis to achieve a status of Wizard in Ulcaster School of Magic. The necklace radiates strong magical energy, but as any graduation project seemed to be not entirely finished. You have a strong suspicion that Nadyala might have worn it for her Candidate's exams.

@362  = ~This enchanted club was taken from the corpse of a Shadow Druid and given to <CHARNAME> by Seniyad, the Archdruid of Cloakwood. While the origins of this deceptively simple, yet astonishingly deadly weapon are unknown, its name and connection with the element of lightning points heavily to the clergy of Talos. Despite the potentially evil forces used in its creation, scrying spells detect no malevolent energies contained within this weapon, thus it is safe to use for anyone who follows the calling of the druid.

 @630  = ~Winski Perorate's Amulet

Winski Perorate's work with the nether regions of the underworld often placed him in close proximity to beings who would prefer Winski to be wearing his skin inside out. To make that possibility less likely, Winski commissioned a nabassu to build an amulet that would ward off evil creatures long enough to gain control of them. Unfortunately, Winski had a momentary lapse in memory due to great injury, and forgot to activate his amulet. This allowed his summoned Tanar'ri access to its summoner, with predictable results.
